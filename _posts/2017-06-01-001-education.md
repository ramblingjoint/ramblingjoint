### Key Takaways
- **Experiences over Academics**: School and colleges teach you more about real life experiences than about academics.
- **Subjects don't matter (that much)**: The subjects you learn during your academical years don't matter much. If you have passion and interest, you can make a living in the field of your intrest.
- **Hands on better than theory**: Always focus on getting experince, do practical work. This is worth more than a degree.
