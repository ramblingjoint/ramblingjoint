### Key Takaways
- No need to be rude to express your opinion on social media.
- Before you post something, think a few times to see if you might end up in a awkward situation.
- Be careful before you add people to your friend/follow list.
- If you end up in an online argument with your friends/relatives, best thing is to have a direct talk.
- Be polite to customer care that uses social media. Remember, it is always a human being on the other side.
