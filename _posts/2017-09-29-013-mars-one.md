### What is it?
Mars One is a mission started by Dutch entrepreneurs Bas Lansdorp and Arno A. Wielders to put humans on Mars starting with a one-way mission.

{[00:48](#t=00:00:48)} SpaceX has revived the interest in space. Since the golden age of space back in the 60s and 70s, there has never been such interest in space as we have now. Thanks to Elon Musk, the private sector is taking over space.

{[02:07](#t=00:02:07)} A little skepticism on the Mars One mission.

{[03:42](#t=00:03:42)} Founded by Bas Lansdorp and Arno A. Wielders. The project has two entities - Mars On Foundation and Mars One Ventures.
