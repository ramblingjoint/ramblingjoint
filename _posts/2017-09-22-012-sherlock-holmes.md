### It's elementary
Sherlock Holmes is one of the most popular fictional characters ever created in the history of fiction by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Both of us have read these stories since our childhood and have been fans since then. Many TV and film adaptations have come out and Holmes always is the best detective character out there.

We just ramble about Sherlock Holmes in this episode.
