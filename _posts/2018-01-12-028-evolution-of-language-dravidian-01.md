### The Language
Language is what sets humans apart from other species. Language evolved as a way of communication many thousands of years ago. Today it is a form of art. Music and literature is a part of every culture across the world.

In this episode we talk about the evolution of languages starting with the Dravidian languages of southern India. We start with Kannada.
